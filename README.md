# About Our Project
UMatter focuses on cis womenâ€™s health and others who have a uterus. We used an NPI API that showcases all the doctors in the United States, however, we targeted OB-GYNs specifically. With this, we want everyone who has a uterus to be able to look for a doctor who is specialized in their care.

The technologies that we used to build our application consisted of VSCode, GitHub, Axios, Heroku, MailChimp, Node.js, JSON, and a doctor-based NPI Registry.
# Getting Started

# How To Run Application
To run the server, you want to go to the terminal and make sure you have npm and axios initialized. And then you want to type 'node server.js' to run the server and retrieve the data that one would receive with the http requests implemented into heir server.js file.

# How To Stop The Application
To stop the server on a Mac, type both command + C in the terminal. 

We used Visual Studios Code for as our main workspace to create static files, add on the node.js modules, and implement the JSON. JSON is a nonrelational database that we used to hold our data. Of course we had a GitHub repository to store all of our code in.
